# COMP4102_Project
## Summary
The goal of this project is to build a cross-platform mobile application that can solve a sudoku puzzle given an unsolved image of the puzzle. The user will be able to take a picture of a sudoku puzzle of their choosing and get a visual representation of the solution in the application. 

## Background
As mentioned above, the goal of this project is to build a cross-platform mobile application that can solve a sudoku puzzle by just taking a picture of the sudoku puzzle. Having a sudoku solver can be extremely helpful for people who might be stuck on a sudoku puzzle and would like to see the solution. This would be easy to do if the puzzle was digital but a lot of people do sudoku puzzles found in newspapers or other physical medium. Manually converting  a puzzle from a physical medium to the digital medium such a sudoku solving website can be time consuming. Having a mobile application that a user can use to quickly snap a picture of a puzzle and have the application show the solution to that puzzle would be one of the best solutions for this problem.

## Project Plan
Building a mobile application can be done by using a mobile development framework such as React Native. It is a framework that can build applications with React. React is a Javascript library used to build user interfaces. Using React Native reduces the amount of coding required to build the application for both iOS and Android. Other tools for building mobile applications were considered such as: Ionic, Flutter, and Standard iOS SDK/ Android SDK but these were not selected as it did not facilitate the needs of our project, and/or would not allow us to complete the development process within the project timeframe.

The computer vision aspect of our project relies on the use of the OpenCV library. OpenCV is written in C++, and ported to Python. In order to make OpenCV functional on the mobile application, the team will need to use an adapter class, or different library to interface with OpenCV. Various operations from the OpenCV library will be needed to be performed in order to make the application functional, the following sections will talk about some of these functions.

## The Challenge
Given the goal, this project can be broken down into four problems. First, is locating the puzzleâ€™s edges regardless of perspective. Next, convert the detected puzzle into a flat square image. Also, the application needs to detect the value and position of each cell in the puzzle. Finally, solve the puzzle (probably via backtracking) and display the completed puzzle on screen.

To solve the first problem we can use techniques like edge detection or invert the light and dark pixels. However, a drawback to this approach is not knowing what the contents of the picture is. If the puzzle is only a small part of the picture, scanning for the numbers and grid is very challenging. To solve this, we can detect the boundaries of the puzzle and scan only within those given coordinates. An algorithm we can use it the Hough transform, which can be used to detect straight lines in an image.

After scanning the puzzle, we can now begin the process of converting the image into a flat square image, which can be done through OpenCV functions such as wrapPerspective and the perspectiveTransform.

The problem of extracting the numbers from the filled out squares can be done by checking each box and applying the MNIST Dataset to recognize the digits found inside. Now that we have the puzzle and the location of all digits in the puzzle, we can create a representation of the sudoku board in memory and apply a backtracking algorithm. Once we have solved the puzzle, we can return the solved puzzle back to the user for them to view. 

There might be few other challenges that we will have to overcome, this includes dealing with situations which may include any of the following:
- There is variable lighting in the provided image.
- There is too much extra noise in the image.
- The image is not sharp or the image is blurry. 
- The image is rotated or flipped.

In order to deal with these issues, multiple OpenCV image operations might be needed to be performed such as increasing or decreasing brightness, contrast, sharpness, blur and other operations such as edge detection and corner detection on the supplied image. If the provided image is unusable the user will have to retake the image.

Another challenge we might face is incomplete puzzles, we cannot always assume that the user will provide us with a clean sudoku puzzle. This means that we have to detect which numbers the user has inputted and which numbers were part of the original puzzle. However, this may prove to be too challenging so we may not be able to tackle this challenge in the provided timeline. A possible solution to this however could be by combining the a machine learning model trained using the MNIST dataset and one trained on the SVHN dataset. The SVHN dataset can help identify computer printed digits. We can use these two models to detect all numbers in the puzzle and then use the one with the higher confidence rating to see if it is written by the user or printed by a computer.Additionally, validating if the puzzle is solvable or not provides another dimension of complexity to the application.
Some of the resources that we need to solve and overcome some of these challenges can be seen in the Project Resources section below.
